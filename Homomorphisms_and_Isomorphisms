We get some basic definitions in order and try and solve a few problems based on this ( from Khanna and Bhambri)

Definition: Let <G,*> and <G',o> bet two groups
A mapping f:G->G' is called a homomorphism if f(a*b) = f(a)of(b) a,b ∊ G

f:G->G'is a homomorphism if f(ab) = f(a)f(b)

f:G->G'is a homomorphism if f(ab) = f(a)f(b)


If, in addition, f happens to be one-one,onto we say that f is an isomorphism and in that case G ≅ G'
Also clearly then f(a1a2....an)= f(a1)f(a2)...f(an) holds under an isomorphism
An onto homomorphism is called epimorphism
A one-one homomorphism is called monomorphism
A homomorphism from a group G to itself is called an endomorphism of G
An isomorphism from a group G to itself is called an automorphism of G
If f:G->G' is onto homomorphism then G' is called homomorphic image of G

Let<Z,+> and <E,+> be the groups of integers and even integers
Define a map f:Z --> E , such that f(x) = 2x for all x ∊ Z
Then f is well defined as x = y => 2x = 2y => f(x) = f(y)
That is f is 1-1 is clear 
f is a homomorphism as f(x+y) = 2(x+y) = 2x + 2y = f(x) + f(y)
Also f is onto as any even integer 2x would have x as its pre-image
Hence f is an isomorphism

Let f be a mapping from <Z,+> the group of integers to the group G = {1,-1} under multiplication defined as
f:Z--> G, s.t
f(x) = 1 if x is even
     = -1 if x is odd
Then f is clearly well defined. We want to know if it is a homomorphism
Let x,y ∊ Z be any elements
Case(i) : x,y are both even, then x + y is even and as f(x+y) = 1 , f(x) = 1, f(y) = 1
We notice f(x+y) = 1 = 1.1 = f(x).f(y)


Case(ii) : x,y are both odd, then x + y is even and f(x+y) = +1 = (-1)(-1) = f(x)f(y)
Case(iii): x is odd, y is even then x + y is odd and f(x+y) = -1 = (-1)(-1) = f(x)f(y)
and thus in all cases f(x+y) = f(x)f(y)
Showing thereby that f is a homomorphism. Is it an isomorphism?
Ontoness is obvious, but f is not 1-1 as f(x) = f(y) does not necessarily mean x=y. Indeed f(2) = f(4) but 2 ≠ 4
Hence not an isomorphism.
