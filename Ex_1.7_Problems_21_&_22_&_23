Problem 21
----------

Show that the group of rigid motions of a cube is isomorphic to S4.

Proof:
--------

Again let G denote the group of rigid motions and let A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, where each i ∈ A corresponds to a pair of opposing vertices on a cube. 
Each α ∈ G sends each pair of opposing vertices to a new pair of opposing vertices. Therefore G acts on A.
Consider the homomorphism φ: G → S4 given by φ(α)(i) = αi.
Then φ is injective since each distinct rigid motion α ∈ G gives rise to a different permutation of A. 
From an earlier Exercise we know that |G| = 24 = |S4|, so φ is in fact an isomorphism.

Problem 22
---------

Show that the group of rigid motions of an octahedron is isomorphic to S4. Deduce that the groups of rigid motions of a cube and an octahedron are isomorphic.

Proof. 
-------

Number each pair of opposing faces of the octahedron 1,2,3,4. 
Let G be the group of rigid motions of the octahedron and let A = {1, 2, 3, 4}. 
Each α ∈ G sends each pair of opposing faces to a new pair of opposing faces, so G acts on A.
As in the previous exercise, we see that the homomorphism φ: G → S4 given by φ(α)(i) = αi.
is injective. By Exercise 1.2.11 we have |G| = 24 = |S4|, so φ is an isomorphism. 
From this and the previous exercise, we see that the groups of rigid motions of the cube and the octahedron are isomorphic.

Problem 23
----------

Explain why the action of the group of rigid motions of a cube on the set of three pairs of opposite faces is not faithful. Find the kernel of this action.

Proof:
------

The group of rigid motions of a cube has order 24 but the permutations on the set of pairs of opposite faces has order |S3| = 6. 
Therefore the action cannot be faithful.
Construct a line through the center of each pair of opposite faces. 
Then a 180◦ rotation about each of these lines will send each pair of opposite faces to itself. 
These are the only rotations that fix pairs of opposing faces, so the kernel of the action consists of these three 180◦ rotations 
along with the identity transformation.
