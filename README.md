# Group-Theory
The chief objective of this repository is to introduce the reader to proofs of Group Theory

Kindly note :

1]This is an earnest attempt to educate the reader on how to write proofs in Group Theory
2] These proofs are entirely my attempt at understanding this topic 
3] As always, the topics are motivated first and then the proof is attempted with an effort to combine the geometric intuition with the algebraic.
4] The reader is referred to the standard textbooks for Abstract Algebra like Dummit and Foote, Serge Lang, Nathan Jacobson and others.
