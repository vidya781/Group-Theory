Problem 1
=========

Let F be a field. Show that the multiplicative group of non zero elements of F ( denoted by F ^ X ) acts on the set F by g.a = ga
where g ∈ F ^ x, a ∈ F and ga is the usual product in F of the two field elements

Proof :
-------

Let g1, g2 ∈ F ^ x 
Then for any a ∈ F,
g1.(g2.a) = g1.g2a = g1(g2a) = (g1g2)a = (g1g2) . a
                                   |
                                   |
                               ( associativity of multiplication in F)
 
  Also , for any a ∈ F ^ x , 1.a = 1a = a,
  Since 1 is the identity of the group F^x
  And 1(0) = 0 ( which follows from the distributivity ) 
  So we can say that 1.a = a for all a ∈ F 
  Therefore the mapping (g,a) -> ga of F ^(x) X F -> F is a group action
  
  Problem 2
  =========
  
  Show that the additive group Z acts on itself by z.a = z + a for all z, a ∈ Z
  
  Proof :
  ------
  
  Let z1 and z2 be two elements in Z, also let a ∈ Z
  Thus z1.(z2.a) = z1 + (z2 + a) = (z1 + z2) + a = (z1 + z2).a
  and 0.a = 0 + a = a
  Therefor Z acts on itself as stated
  
  Problem 3
 ===========
 Show that the additive group R acts on the x,y plane R x R by r.(x,y) = (x + ry,y)
 
 Proof:
 ------
 
 For any r1,r2 in R^2, we have r1.(r2.(x,y)) 
                              = r1.(r2.(x,y))
                              = r1(x + r2y,y)
                              = (x + r2y + r1y,y)
                              = ( x + (r1 + r2)y, y)
                              = (r1 + r2).(x,y)
   And 0.(x,y) = x + 0.y, y
               = (x,y)
   Therefore R acts on R^2 in the manner stated above
