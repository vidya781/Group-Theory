In this post , we describe two proof approaches to the same problem: one that has less rigor and one that has more and contrast
the two approaches.

This is problem 5 from D&F off Exercise 1

If n is odd and n >= 3, show that the idenity is the only element of D(2n) which commutes with all the elements of D(2n) 

Proof by Induction : In which we will be using the induction hypotheses
Lets check for n = 3, D6 = {1,r,r^2,......sr^2}
Identity of D6 is e = 1
Suppose e is also the identity for D(4k+2) = {1,r,r^2,....sr^2k}
We pick at random one of the elements and run the commutative principle on it:

    e(sr^2k) = (sr^2k) e ( by induction Hypotheses)
    
    for n = k + 1, we have that D(4k+3) = {1,r,r^2,...r^4k+2,.....sr^(4k+2)}
    
   Now e(sr^2k) = (e s)r^2k = s e ^(-1) r^2k = s(e^(-1))r^2k = sr^2k.e
   That is e(sr^2k) = (sr^2k) e
   Now use this fact : e(s r^(4k+2)) = e(s.s^4k.r^2) = s e^(-1)r^4k.r^2 = s(r^4k.e) r^2 = sr^4k+2.e^-1 = sr^4k+2 . e 
                                                                                       (Replacing e^-1 by e as in D2n e = e^-1)
  This proof does not concretely establish e as the only identity element given the conditions but only uses the induction
  hypotheses as a means to establish this fact.
  So we need a different approach : We must opine that there may be two different elements that could serve as the identity
  but prove down the line that both these elements are one ands the same.In other words, the identity element must be unique.
  
  Proof by contradiction :
  
  Let x be in D(2n) such that xy = yx for all y in D(2n)
  Then x = s^a r^b for some a in {0,1}
  b in {0,1,.....n-1}
  
  Suppose that a = 1
  Then r x = r( s^a r^b) = r(s r ^ b) = s r ^(-1) r ^ b = s r ^( b - 1)
  But r x = x r = ( s r ^ b) r = s r ^(b + 1)
  Thus s r ^( b - 1 ) = s r ^(b + 1)
  => r^( b - 1) = r ^(b + 1) = r ^ 2 = e which is a contradiction as we know that in D2n , r^2 =/= e, only s^2 is.
  So if any element commutes with any other, it must be of the form, x = s^0 r^b = r^b
  Then s x = s r ^ b
       s x = x s = r^b s = s r ^ (-b) 
       s r ^ b = s r ^(-b) , => r ^(2b) = e
       Thus 2b = kn , r ^ (kn) = e for some k                          if b = 0, then k = 0
       0<=b<=(n-1) , we consider the end point values,                 
       2(n-1) = k n 
       => n = 2 / (2 - k) 
       => k in {0,1} for n to be in integers
       
       if k = 1 2b = n which is not possible as n is odd as per the problem, hence we must have k = 0
       Hence b = 0 
       Thus the only element of D(2n) which commutes with all others is x = r ^ 0 = e
