We take a look at group rotations of different geometric structures. But first we take a more generalized standpoint :

If we are to find the order of the cyclic subgroup of D(2n) generated by r, what route do we take ?

Approach / Idea : Geometrically we know that r represents a rotation by 2pi/n and that n is the smallest power or r such
that r ^ n = 1 . Now r^(2pi/n)*(n) = r^(2pi) and we have identity.
Therefore we say that the order of r is n and hence { r^k | k in Z } = { e = r^0,r,r^2,....r^(n-1) }

We define R^3 to be the group of rotations of the given Platonic solid . We proceed to look at the following structures:

1) Let G be the group of rigid motions in R^3 of a tetrahedron , show that |G| = 12

(all 4 figures are included)

Consider a tetrahedron. There are 4 faces, 3 edges on each triangular face. Lets call O to be the apex where all 4 faces 
converge.
Anticlockwise direction : A, B,C, D are 4 points that are there on the floor.
We see that : OAB ---> OBC, ODC, ODA 
In words, OAB could go to OBC or ODC or ODA by rotation 
Hence, in order to elucidate the group actions, we say that each of the 4 faces can have 3 positions to go and still retain 
identity. Hence the order of G = 4 * 3 = 12 

2) Let G be the group of rigid motions in R^3 of a cube. Show that |G| = 24

Consider a cube which has 6 faces. Call the 6 faces : ADCB, BCEF, FEHG, GHDA, ABFG, DCEH and lets take a single face ADCB.

On Right Rotation: ADCB -> BCEF ( R)
                   ADCB -> AGHD ( L) on 1 rotation
                   ADBC -> ABFG ( top )
                   ADBC -> CEHD (bottom) 

So there are 6 faces and for each there are 4 positions that preserve the group rotations, so 6 * 4 = 24 

3) Let G be the group of rigid motions in R^3 of an octahedron. Show that |G| = 24

Consider an octahedron : O is one apex and like the previous config, A,B,C,D are the base faces and O' is the apex opposite to 
O.We say that each of the 8 faces can have 3 positions to go and retain identity.Hence the order of G = 8 * 3 = 24

4) Let G be the group of rigid motions in R^3 of a dodecahedron. Show that |G| = 24

There are 12 flat faces : Lets take a representative pentagon and call it AEDCB in the clockwise orientation. Then we take the 
pentagon through a series of 5 rotations to bring it back in place. Therefore we must have 12 * 5 = 60 as the order of |G| 
that preserves the group identity

5) Let G be the group of rigid motions in R^3 of an icosahedron. Show that |G| = 60

An icosahedromn has got 12 polyhedron vertices, 30 polyhedra edges, 20 equivalent equilateral triangles
We say that each edge of those 30, has 2 positions to go and still retain group identity. Therefore we say that 30 * 2 = 60
is the order of G , |G| = 60

Since group identities are preserved across symmetrical structures, we say that the structures 'retain' or 'preserves' identity
when a series of actions are taken on it.Like in this case, rotation, denoted in 3 dimensional space by R^3.
