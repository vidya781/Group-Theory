Continuing onward with some more problems from D&F , we pose the following problems:

Find a set of generators for Z and a set of generators for Z/nZ

In one case we have Z and if we take the realm of positive integers (+) , then we can easily see that 1 is the generator
and every k in Z can be obtained by adding 1 or -1 to itself ( 1 to ascend, and -1 to descend). Thus formally we can 
represent this by : k = { k = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1......+ 1    k > 0
                               ---------------------
                                      k times
                          k 1 = 0                      k = 0
                          |k|(-1) = -1 + -1 + .....+ -1 
                                    --------------------    = k < 0
                                        ( k times ) 
                                        
 In order to tackle the second part of the question, if we assume they mean Z/nZ as an additive group, with the usual definition
 of addition on Z/nZ , then 1bar is a generator because for every kbar in Z/nZ, k1bar = kbar.1bar satisfying the relation n.1bar
 = 0bar where 0bar is the identity element.
 
 
 
 Show that the group < x1, y1 | x1^2 = y1^2 = (x1,y1)^2 = 1 > is the dihedral group D4 ( where x1 may be replaced by the 
 letter r and y1 by s ) [ Show that the last relation is the same as x1y1 = x1 y1 ^(-1)]
 
 Lets first write out D4 = {1,r,s,sr} and do a mapping x1 = r , y1 = s, we easily see that x1^2 = r^2 = 1 and y1^2 = s^2 = 1 
 as per the rules and now lets form tuples like (1,r)
                                                (r,s)
                                                (s,sr) 
  We have already seen that that the square relationship for the first 2 tuples hold good. 
  Now for (s,sr) ^ 2 we see that s^2 = 1 and (sr)^2 = (sr)(sr) = s(rs)r = s(sr^-1)r = s^2 = 1 Thus the first part of the question
  is proved.
  
  Also we have that rs = x1y1 = (x1y1)^-1  ( as x1 = x1^-1, y1 = y1^-1) 
                              = y1^-1x1^-1 = y1 x1^-1 = sr^-1 
  Thus r and s satisfy the relations on x1 and y1 and x1,y1 satisfy the relations for r and s.
  
  Now D4 = <r,s | r^2 = s^2 = 1 , rs = sr^-1 > = < x1, y1 | x1^2 = y1^2 = (x1,y1)^2 = 1 > 
 

Let X2n be the group whose presentation is < x, y | x^n = y^2 = 1, xy = yx^2 >

a) Show that n = 3k, then X2n has order 6, and it has the same generators and relations as D6 when x is replaced by r 
and y by s
b) Show that if (3,n) = 1 , then x satisfies the additional relation : x = 1 and in this case deduce that X2n has order 2
( Use the facts x^n = 1 and x^3 = 1 )

Solution :

a)Taken from DF, X2n = <x,y | x^n = y^2 = 1, xy = yx^2 >

The commutation relation xy = yx^2 determines how to commute y and x ( in real terms, this means moving y from the right of 
x to the left ), so that just as in the group D2n every element in X2n can be written in the form y^kx^i with all the powers 
of y on the left and all powers of x on the right. Also, by the first two relations any powers of x and y can be reduced so
that i lies between 0 and n-1 and k is 0 or 1. We conjecture that the order of the group could be 2n but we see the following.

1 = y^2,
x = xy^2 = (xy)y = (yx^2) y = (yx)(xy) = (yx)(yx^2) = y(xy)x^2 = y(yx^2)x^2 = y^2x^4 = x^4

Since x^4 = x it follows by the cancellation law, that x^3 = 1 in X(2n) and so it follows that X(2n) has order at most 6 for
any n

 Now, x^3 = 1
 Multiplying by x^-1 on both sides
 x^2 = x^-1
 and so x^n = 1 
 
 Now Lets take the case for D2n = <r,s | r^n = s^2 = 1, rs = sr^-1 > and for D6, we must have 2n = 6, so n = 3 and so r^3 = 1
 and replacing r by x , we get x^3 = 1, y^2 = 1, xy = yx^-1
 and these are the same relations as in D6 and since this representation defines D6 which is of order 6 , we therefore conclude
 that this is the order of X2n
 
 b) Suppose that (n,3) = 1, that is n is not divisible by 3 and n can be written as n = 3k +- 1 
 Now using the facts that x^n = 1, and x^3 = 1, we get 1 = x^n = x^(3k +/- 1) = (x^3)k x ^(+/-) 1 = x ^(+/-) 1
 if 1 = x ^ 1, x = 1 
 if 1 = x^(-1) , left multiplying by x , x = x.x^(-1) = 1 
 So in both cases, x = 1
 Thus the group presentation, G = { y | y ^ 2 = 1 } , so G = { 1, y } ( we have not written x as x = 1) and the order this
 group is 2.
 
 
 
 Let Y be the group whose presentation is as follows :
 Y = <u,v | u^4 = v^3 = 1, uv = v^2u^2 >
 a) Show that v^2 = v^-1 ( Use the relation v^3 = 1)
 b) Show that v commutes with u^3 ( show that v^2u^3v = u^3 by writing the lefthand side as (v^2u^2)(uv) and using the relations
 to reduce this to the right hand side, then use part(a)
 c) Show that v commutes with u 
 d) Show that uv = 1
 e) Show that u = 1, deduce that v = 1 and conclude Y = 1 ( use part (d) and the equation u^4v^3 = 1 )

 
 Solution :
 
a) v^3 = 1
 v^3.V^-1 = 1.v^-1
 => v^2 = v^(-1)
 
 b) v commutes with u^3 
    Now v^2u^3 v = (v^2u^2)(uv) 
                   By associativity
                   = (uv) (v^2u^2)
                   = u(v.v^2)u^2 
                   = u.u^2 
                   = u^3
    v^2u^3v = u^3
    v(v^2u^3v) = vu^3
    => v^3u^3v = vu^3
    u^3v = vu^3 , so v commutes with u^3
    
    c) Now u(u^3v) = u(vu^3)
           u(u^3v) = u(vu^3) 
           (uu^3)v = uv(u^3)
           v = uvu^3 ( as u^4 = 1)
           => vu = uv ( multiplying both sides by u on the right)
           
    d) vu = uv
    => vu = v^2u^2 ( by definition in the presentation)
    If we multiply both sides by v^-1 on the left and u^-1 on the right, we get vu = 1 and hence uv = 1 as desired
    
    
    d) (u^4)(v^3) = (1)(1)   by definition of Y
                  = (u^3)(uv)(v^2) by associativity
                  = u^3(v^2) by the part (d)
                  = u^2(uv)v by associativity
                  = u(uv) by associativity
                  = u ( by part (d) )
                  
       So we have that u = 1 and since uv = 1, v = 1. Thus Y is generated by u = 1, v = 1 which means {Y} = 1
