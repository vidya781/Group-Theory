We illustrate some examples of Kernels 

Let f:G-> G' be a group homomorphism. Let e and e' be the respective unit elements of G and G'. We define the kernel of f to be the 
subset of G consisting of all x such that f(x) = e'.

From the definitions, it follows at once that the kernel H of f is a subgroup of G.
Let us prove that H is closed under the inverse mapping. Let x ∈ H.
Then f(x^(-1))f(x) = f(e) = e'

Since f(x) = e', we have f(x^(-1)) = e' whence x^(-1) ∈ H . Other verifications can be easily checked.(Criteria to be a subgroup)

Let f:G->G' be a group homomorphism again. Let H' be the image of f. Then H' is a subgroup of G', because it contains e' and if f(x), f(y) ∈ H'
then f(xy) = f(x)f(y) lies also in H'.
Furthermore f(x^(-1)) = f(x)^(-1) is in H' and hence H' is a subgroup of G'
The kernel and image of f are sometimes denoted by Ker f and Im f.

A homomorphism f:G -> G' which establishes an isomorphism between G and its image in G' will also be called an embedding
                                                                                                               ---------
A homomorphism whose kernel is trivial is injective.
To prove this, suppose that the kernel of f is trivial and let f(x) = f(y) for some x,y ∈ G.
Multiplying by f(y^-1) we obtain,
f(xy^-1) = f(x)f(y^-1) = e'
Hence xy^-1 lies in the kernel, hence xy^-1 = e and x = y
If in particular f is also surjective, then f is an isomorphism. Thus a surjective homomorphism whose kernel is trivial must be
an isomorphism. We note that an injective homomorphism is an embedding

An injective homomorphism is often denoted by a special arrow, as f: G ➥ G'
