Problem 4
=========

Let G be a group acting on a set A and fix some a in A. Show that the following sets are subgroups of G
a) The kernel of the action
b) { g ∈ G | ga = a }--This subgroup is called the stabilizer of a in G

Solution :
--------

Suppose g,h are in the kernel of the action. Then for any b ∈ A,
(gh).b = g.(h.b) = g.b = b [ Why ? g1(g2.a) = (g1.g2).a for all g1,g2 ∈ G, a ∈ A and 1.a = a for all a ∈ A]

so gh is in the kernel, and the kernel is closed under group operation.
Moreover, if g is in the kernel then
b = 1.b = (g^-1 g).b = g^-1.(g.b) = g^-1 . b
so g^-1 is in the kernel 

Therefore the kernel of the group action is a nonempty subset of G which is closed under the binary action of G 
and which is closed under inverses so the kernel is a subgroup of G

b) { g ∈ G | ga = a } ( called the stabilizer of a in G }

Proof:
------
The stabilizer of a is nonempty since 1 is a member. Now let g, h be any members of the stabilizer 
Then, (gh).a = g.(h.a) = g.a = a,
so the stabilizer is closed under the group action. It is also closed under inverses since
a = 1.a = (g^-1 g).a = g^-1.(g.a) = g^-1.a
Therefore the stabilizer is a subgroup of G


Problem 5
=========

Prove that the kernel of an action of the group G on the set A is the same as the kernel of the corresponding permutation representation 
G -> SA

Proof:
-----

Let p: G->SA be the permutation representation of the group actionon A, so that for g ∈ G and a ∈ A,
p(g)(a) = g.a
If g ∈ ker p, then p(g) = 1, where 1 is the identity permutation on A
Then g.a = a for all a ∈ A, and g is in the kernel of the action.
Conversely, if g is in the kernel of the action, then g.a = a for all a ∈ A, so that p(g) = 1 and g ∈ ker p.
Therefore the kernel of the group action and the kernel fo the corresponding permutation represenetation are the same.

Problem 6
=========

Prove that a group G acts faithfully on a set A iff the kernel of the action is the set consisting only of the identity.

Proof:
------

If G acts on a set B and distinct elements of G induce distinct permutations of B, the action is said to be faithful.
A faithful action is therefore one in which the associated permutation representation is injective.

The kernel of the action of G on B is defined to be { g ∈ G | gb = b for all b ∈ B }, namely the elements of G which fix
all the elements of B. For the trivial action, the kernel of teh action is all of G and this action is not faithful when |G| > 1

Proof: We attempt a proof by comparison.

First, let us suppose that G acts faithfully on A and let g be an element in the kernel of the action..
Then g.a = a for all a ∈ A. However, 1.a = a for all a ∈ A, so the elements 1 and g induce the same permutation on A. Since G
acts faithfully , this means that g = 1, so that the kernel of the action is the set {1}.

For the converse, suppose that the kernel of the action is the set {1}. Pick two elements g and h in G
and suppose that g and h induce the same permutation on A. Then for any a ∈ A, g.a = h.a
But then
a = (g^-1g).a = g^-1.(g.a) = g^-1.(h.a) = (g^-1 h).a
Therefore g^-1 h is in the kernel of the action, so g^-1 h = 1
This implies that g = h , so that distinct elements in G must induce distinct permutations on A.
This shows that G acts faithfully on A.
