What are generators and what are relations in the context of D2n ?

Let's take a very simple example: If we consider Z ( the set of positive integers and negative integers ), then 2 can be 
generated by the relation 1 + 1 = 2 , we can get back 1 by the operation 2 + (-1) = 1. Thus we are led to believe that all
subsequent integers like 3, 4, 5.... can be generated by the action of 1 and an operator like + acting on it. With this in 
mind, we can now define formally the concept of generators :

A subset S of elements of a group G with the property that every element of G can be written as a finite product of elements
of S and their inverses is called a set of generators of G. Notationally, G = < S > and say G is generated by S or in other
words S generates G. 

G = < S >
Z = < 1 >

Now consider D(2n) which is the set of symmetries of a regular n-gon as described in the post on Dihedral groups and we took 
the specific example of D6 = { 1,r,r^2,s,sr,sr^2 } and D8 = { 1,r,r^2,r^3,s,sr,sr^2,sr^3 }

Observe that that both groups are composed of r and s in varying combinations, so surely we can infer that the generators of 
these groups must involve r and s. That is, S = {r,s} is a generator of D(2n) so D(2n) = <r,s> and we assert that in a finite
group G, the set S generates G if every element of G is a finite product of elements of S ( that is , it is not necessary to
include the inverses of the elements of S as well ).

We further say that any equations in a general group G that the generators satisfy are called relations in G. Thus in D(2n),
we have r^n = 1, s^2 = 1, rs = sr^-1. In D(2n) these three relations have the additional property that any other relation 
between elements of the group may be derived from these three intrinsically. This is a consequence of the fact that we can 
determine exactly when two group elements are equal by using only these three relations.

Lets say there is a collection of relations R1, R2, R3... Rm ( here each Ri is an equation in the elements from S U { 1 } 
such that any relation among the elements of S can be deduced from these , we call these generators and relations a 
presentation of G and depict this as G = < S | R1,R2,.....Rm>

One presentation for the dihedral group D(2n) ( using the generators and relations above) 
D(2n) = <r,s | r^n = s^2 = 1, rs = sr^(-1) >

The goal of these presentations is to simplify working with groups and on this basis we solve a few problems the source of 
which is attributed to D & F ( Dummit and Foote from now on , SL for Serge Land, NJ for Nathan Jacobson)

The question is :

Use the generators and relations above to show that if x is any element of D(2n) which is not a power of r, then rx = xr^(-1)

Proof : x is in D(2n) and x =/= r^k for any k, 
       Let x = sr^k ( why is this true ? because if k = 0, we get x = s, a basal element of D2n, and by choice of k , we can 
                       ensure that some of the elements of D2n will be represented by x = sr^k surely)
       Multiplying by r on both sides from the left, we have
       rx = rsr^k
          = sr^(-1) r^k ( from the rules and from the previous lemma)
          = sr^(k-1) 
          = sr^k.r^(-1) 
          = xr^(-1). ( hence proved)
          
A subsequent question is :

Use generators and relations to show that every element of D(2n) which is not a power of r has order 2. Deduce that D(2n) 
is generated by the two elements s and sr both of which are order 2.

Proof : Let us suppose that and element of D(2n) is not a power of r. Then we can suppose it is of the form sr^k for some 
integer k. Then (sr^k)2 = (sr^k)(sr^k) = s(r^k s) r^k = s(s r^ (-k))s = s^2 r^(k-k) = s^2 = 1 

So the element must atleast be of order 2. We know that an element is of order 1 iff it is the group identity, and sr^k != 1
for any k , now lets suppose it is and right multiply it with s,
s ( sr^ k) = s^2 r ^ k = r ^ k =/= s which is what we started off with and hence can conclude that every element that is not
a power of r is of order 2

Now for the second part, we see that D(2n) is generated by s and sr, and actually D(2n) is generated by r and s, it suffices 
to show that we can generate r with s and sr. 
Indeed s(sr) = s^2 r = r and so <r,sr> generates D(2n) as well.
