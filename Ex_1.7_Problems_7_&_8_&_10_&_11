Problem 7
--------
Prove that in Example 2 in this section the action is faithful

Proof
-----
If V is a vector space over a field F, then the multiplicative group F(x) acts on the set V via the mapping a.v = av 
for all a in F(x) and v in V. We wish to show the action is faithful.

Let a,b be in F(x) be such that a.v = b.v for all v in V
Then 0 = a.v + -(a.v)
       = a.v + -(b.v)
       = a.v - b.v
       = (a-b)v
       
 Since (a-b)v is 0 even when v is nonzero, this implies that a-b = 0 or a = b
 If distinct elements induce distinct permutations on V then the action is faithful and therefore in this case, the action is faithful
 
 Problem 8
 ---------
 
 Let A be a nonempty set and let k be a positive integer with k <= |A|
 The symmetric group S(A) acts on the set B consisting of all subsets of A of cardinality k 
 by S.{a1,....ak} = {S(a1),.....S(ak)}
 
 S stands for sigma
 
 a) Prove that this is a group action
 
 Proof:
 ------
 
 Suppose S1,S2 be in S(A). Then for any subset {a1,....ak}
 S1.(S2.{a1,.....ak}) = S1.{S2(a1),....S2(ak)}
                      = {S1(S2(a1)),....S1(S2(ak))}
                      = (S1 o S2).{a1....ak}
 And 1.{a1,.....,ak} = {1(a1),.....1(ak)} = {a1,....ak}
 Hence the specified mapping is a group action
 
 b) Describe explicitly how the elements (1 2) and (1 2 3) act on the six 2-element subsets of {1,2,3,4}
 
 Solution
 --------
 
 We have (1 2).{1,2} = {2,1},
         (1 2).{1,3} = {2,3},
         (1 2).{2,4} = {2,4},
         (1 2).{1,4} = {1,3},
         (1 2).{2,3} = {1,4},
         (1 2).{3,4} = {3,4},
 and 
         (1 2 3).{1,2} = {2,3},
         (1 2 3).{1,3} = {2,1},
         (1 2 3).{1,4} = {2,4},
         (1 2 3).{2,3} = {3,1},
         (1 2 3).{2,4} = {3,4},
         (1 2 3).{3,4} = {1,4}.

Problem 10
----------

With reference to the preceding two exercises determine:
(a) For which values of k the action of Sn on k-element subsets is faithful

Solution
--------

The action of S(A) on k-element subsets of a set A is faithful for all integers k with 1 <= k < |A|, which we proceed to show.

Suppose S1 and S2 are distinct permutations in S(A). Label the elements of A as {a1,a2,.....an}, where n = |A|
Without loss of generality , we may suppose that S1(a1) =/= S2(a1)

Now take any k-element subset B of A which has a1 but which does not contain (S1^-1 o S2 ) (a1) ( This is possible since 1<= k < |A|)
Then S1.B does not contain S2(a1), however S2.B does
Therefore distinct permutations in S(A) induce distinct permutations on the k-element subsets of A, so the action is faithful
(again, assuming 1<=k< |A|)

b) For which values of k the action of S(n) on ordered k-tuples is faithful

Solution:
--------

The action of S(A) on ordered k-tuples of elements of A is faithful for all integers k with 1<=k<=|A|
To see this, suppose that S1, S2 are distinct permutations in S(A). 
Suppose for example that S1(a1) =/= S2(a1) and consider the k-tuple B = (a1,a2,....ak)
Then the first coordinate in S1.B is distinct from the first coordinate of S2.B
Therefore distinct permutations in S(A) induce distinct permutations on the set of k-tuples, so the action is faithful.

Problem 11
----------
Write the cycle decomposition of the eight permutations in S4 corresponding to the elements in D8 given by the action of
D8 on the vertices of a square

Solution:
---------
Let P:D8--> S4 be the permutation representation associated to the action of D8 on the vertices {1,2,3,4}
of a square.Then 
P(1) = 1,
P(r)   = (1 2 3 4),
P(r^2) = (1 3)(2 4),
P(r^3) = (1 4 3 2),
P(s) = (2 4),
P(sr) = (1 4)(2 3),
P(sr^2) = (1 3),

P(sr^3) = (1 2)(3 4)
