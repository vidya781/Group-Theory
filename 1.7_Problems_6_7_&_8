Prove that a group G acts faithfully on a set A iff the kernel of the action is the set consisting only of the identity

Proof:
-----

First, suppose that G acts faithfully on A and let g be an element in the kernel of the action. Then g.a = a for all a in A.
However 1.a = a for all a in A, so the elements 1 and g induce the same permutation on A.
Since G acts faithfully , this must mean that g = 1, so that the kernel of the action is the set {1}

For the converse, we suppose that kernel of the action is the set {1}.
Pick any two elements g and h in G and suppose g and h induce the same permutation on A.
Then for any a in A, g.a = h.a

But a = (g^-1g).a = g^-1.(g.a) = g^-1.(h.a) = (g^-1 h).a.
Therefore g^-1h is in the kernel of action so g^-1h = 1
This implies g = h, so that distinct elements in G must induce distinct permutations on A.
This proves G acts faithfully on A

Problem 7
--------
Prove that in Example 2 in this section the action is faithful

Proof
-----
If V is a vector space over a field F, then the multiplicative group F(x) acts on the set V via the mapping a.v = av 
for all a in F(x) and v in V. We wish to show the action is faithful.

Let a,b be in F(x) be such that a.v = b.v for all v in V
Then 0 = a.v + -(a.v)
       = a.v + -(b.v)
       = a.v - b.v
       = (a-b)v
       
 Since (a-b)v is 0 even when v is nonzero, this implies that a-b = 0 or a = b
 If distinct elements induce distinct permutations on V then the action is faithful and therefore in this case, the action is faithful
 
 Problem 8
 ---------
 
 Let A be a nonempty set and let k be a positive integer with k <= |A|
 The symmetric group S(A) acts on the set B consisting of all subsets of A of cardinality k 
 by S.{a1,....ak} = {S(a1),.....S(ak)}
 
 S stands for sigma
 
 a) Prove that this is a group action
 
 Proof:
 ------
 
 Suppose S1,S2 be in S(A). Then for any subset {a1,....ak}
 S1.(S2.{a1,.....ak}) = S1.{S2(a1),....S2(ak)}
                      = {S1(S2(a1)),....S1(S2(ak))}
                      = (S1 o S2).{a1....ak}
 And 1.{a1,.....,ak} = {1(a1),.....1(ak)} = {a1,....ak}
 Hence the specified mapping is a group action
 
 b) Describe explicitly how the elements (1 2) and (1 2 3) act on the six 2-element subsets of {1,2,3,4}
 
 Solution
 --------
 
 We have (1 2).{1,2} = {2,1},
         (1 2).{1,3} = {2,3},
         (1 2).{2,4} = {2,4},
         (1 2).{1,4} = {1,3},
         (1 2).{2,3} = {1,4},
         (1 2).{3,4} = {3,4},
 and 
         (1 2 3).{1,2} = {2,3},
         (1 2 3).{1,3} = {2,1},
         (1 2 3).{1,4} = {2,4},
         (1 2 3).{2,3} = {3,1},
         (1 2 3).{2,4} = {3,4},
         (1 2 3).{3,4} = {1,4}.
